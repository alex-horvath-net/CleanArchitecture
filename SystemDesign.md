###  1. Receiver → Buffer 
Operation: Adds item to a BlockingCollection.

🔁 Latency: ~10–30 µs (negligible)

⚡ Throughput: ~500k–1M ticks/sec (receiver thread can ingest this easily)

✅ Handles burst ingestion (e.g., 10,000 ticks in 100ms burst)

✅ Zero blocking unless buffer is full

### 2. Buffer → Publisher → Batch Creation
Operation: Publisher pulls from buffer and accumulates ticks into a list.

⏳ Latency:

Controlled by:

BatchSizeThreshold = 250

PublishIntervalThreshold = 100ms

→ If batch fills quickly: ~20–40ms

→ Otherwise: capped at 100ms wait

📦 Throughput:

If 4 publishers run in parallel, each sending 250 ticks per 100ms →

4 x 250 x 10 = 10,000 ticks/sec

(scales linearly with parallelism)

## 🎯 Business Goal (Level 1)

**As a Trader, I want to see live market data so I can decide whether to place a trade.**

---

## 💵 Business Strategy (Level 2)

Access real-time price updates for relevant instruments as soon as they change.

---

## 🛠️ High-Level Tactical System Design (Level 3)

🔴 **Problem:** The trader has no way to view live market movements.  
✅ **Solution:** Add a `Blazor UI – Live Market Data View` to display real-time price updates.

> This is the only component introduced at this stage — the first point of user-system interaction.
